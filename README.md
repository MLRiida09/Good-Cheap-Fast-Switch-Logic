# Good Cheap Fast Switch Logic

This project simulates the famous "Project Management Triangle" using three interactive switches:
- **Good**
- **Cheap**
- **Fast**

## 📌 Concept
You can only choose **two** out of the three:
- If you choose **Good** and **Cheap**, it **can't be Fast**.
- If you choose **Cheap** and **Fast**, it **won't be Good**.
- If you choose **Fast** and **Good**, it **won't be Cheap**.

This logic is often used in project management to show trade-offs in time, quality, and cost.

## 🚀 How it works
- You toggle the switches.
- The script ensures that only two of the three options are enabled at a time.
- If you turn on a third switch, one of the others will automatically turn off to respect the rule.
